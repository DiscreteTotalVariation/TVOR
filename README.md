# TVOR: Finding Discrete Total Variation Outliers among Histograms

This is the repository with the source code and experiments that were conducted for the discrete total variation outlier detection method proposed in the paper "TVOR: Finding Discrete Total Variation Outliers among Histograms" by Nikola Banić and Neven Elezović.

## Code

The code is written for Python 3 and it can be used to recreate the main results presented in the paper. It can also be changed to check the behavior in conditions not mentioned in the paper.
